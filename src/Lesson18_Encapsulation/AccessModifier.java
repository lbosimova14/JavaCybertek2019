                ex: public int num =100;
        private: only visible within the class
                not visible outside the class
                ex: private int num=100;
        default: only visible to the classes in the same package
                not visible outside the package
                ex: int num = 100;
        protected: only visible to the classes in the same package.
                not visible outside package
                but it's inheritable outside the package
